# Flexure
## Module for Micro Electrical Discharge Machining with Gaseous Dielectrics

With a positioning error ofless than 16 μm/100 mm and a repeatability of less than 2 μm the axes reached a feed rate up to vf = 10 mm/s. For the realisation of a high dynamic movement for gap width control a piezo unit installed on the linear axes was developed. {page 41}
