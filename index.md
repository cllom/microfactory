# Abstract
## Research on Making a Fabricator
"It's a fabricator. It can analyze, design, construct basically anything." ― Peter Parker to Norman Osborn [Stark Industries Fabricator](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Stark_Industries_Fabricator)
Drawing inspiration from the realm of science fiction, this research delves into the feasibility, challenges, and potential applications of creating a real-world fabricator.

# Introduction
The idea of a fabricator is reminiscent of the  [Replicator](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Replicator) from Star Trek, which could produce almost any object on demand. In the real world, the closest analogs are 3D printers and CNC machines, which can produce objects from digital designs. However, a true fabricator would have broader capabilities, including the ability to produce complex objects with multiple materials.

# Current Technologies

## Additive Manufacturing
Create objects layer by layer from materials like plastic, metal, and even biological tissue. 
* 3D-printed microelectronics for integrated circuitry and passive wireless sensors

## Subtractive Manufacturing
Carving out objects from solid blocks of material.

# Research Questions
## Feasibility and Intergration
* How can the different technologies of 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting be seamlessly integrated into a single machine?
* What are the technical challenges in combining additive and subtractive manufacturing processes?

By addressing these research questions, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of current fabrication technologies. This will pave the way for more efficient, versatile, and sustainable manufacturing solutions in the future.

# Spiral Development
Goal: Create a machine that integrates various single-purpose modular devices like 3D printers, CNC milling machines, lathes and laser cutters to create almost anything.

## Phase 1: Automated Modular 3D Printing Farm with Product Dispensing
Create an automated 3D printing farm with modular printers that dispense finished products.
